# Red - A multifunction Discord bot
#### *Now fully modular*

This is a work in progress. Bugs and missing features are to be expected.

The only requirement for the main part is:
```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@async
```
The requirements for the audio module are:
```
pip3 install youtube_dl
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
Opus/ffmpeg
```
Either you install ffmpeg and opus from the original sources or you can download them directly from the [main branch](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot).  
Just click on the 3 .exes and the opus dll, then click on the "raw" button to download them.  
If you do this, you also need to put them in the main folder, next to red.py
